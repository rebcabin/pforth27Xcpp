<b> <H1> Using ANS Forth:</H1> <BR> 
A report from the trenches</b>
<P>
We will take a look at the practicalities of using ANS Forth systems and
see what present systems are providing.
<P>
<UL><LI> What ANS Forth's are available
<LI> The basics: loading the system
<LI> File I/O
<LI> What is <b> really</b> different
<LI> Summary: Can it be used for large projects ?
</UL>
<P>
<b> <H1> What ANS Forths are available ?</H1></b>
<P>
The simple answer is: <b> none</b>
<P>
There are <i> no</i> Forth systems around that satisfy the ANS standard document
as it is strictly interpreted.
<P>
The primary reason for this is the expense of the offical standard document,
and it is not proper to claim standards compliance to
<A HREF=../forth/dpans.html>the draft standard</A>.
<P>
Fortunately, this is of no real practical impact.  There are several systems
available that are modeled on the draft standard; they are not officially
standard, but for all practical purposes they are standard systems.
<P>
All of these systems are in the public domain or shareware, they include
<P>
<UL><LI> <tt> F68KANS</tt>, for the 68xxx family by Joerg Plewe
(<tt> jps@Forth-eV.de</tt>)
<LI> <tt> PFE</tt>, for MS-DOS, Linux, Unix by Dirk Zoller
<BR>
(<tt> duz@roxi.rz.fth-mannheim.de</tt>)
<LI> <tt> gForth</tt> by Bernd Paysan (<tt> paysan@informatik.tu-muenchen.de</tt>)
<LI> <tt> iForth</tt> by Marcel Hendrix (<tt> mhx@bbs.forth-ev.de</tt>)
<LI> <tt> ThisForth</tt>, for practically anything with a C compiler, by Wil
Baden
<LI> <tt> Win32For</tt> by Tom Zimmer and Andrew McKewan
</UL>
<P>
The last two in the above list are not strictly compliant, but are close
enough to put in this list.
<P>
There are <i> no</i> commercial systems that claim compliance.
<P>
There is are two pieces of software that you can use to test compliance to
the standard:
<P>
<UL><LI> To test the compliance of the <i> compiler</i>, there is John Hayes'
<A HREF=ftp://ftp.taygeta.com/pub/Forth/ANS/tester.fr>test</A> suite
( there is a <A HREF=ftp://ftp.taygeta.com/pub/Forth/ANS/core.fr> second file</A>).
<LI> To test the compliance of the <i> application</i>, there is Jet Thomas'
<A HREF=ftp://ftp.taygeta.com/pub/Forth/ANS/stand4th.zip><tt> Stand4th</tt> program</A>.
</UL>
<P>
<H1> <b> Loading the system</b> (MS-DOS and Unix)</H1>
<P>
These systems are ``toolbox'' Forth systems ---- Forth is only one tool in
the programmers toolbox.  Source files are edited from outside of Forth,
external debugging tools are also required as no special debuggers are
provided from <i> within</i> these Forths. (An excellant
<A HREF=ftp://ftp.taygeta.com/pub/Forth/ANS/debugger.ans> ANS debugger</A> is
the one written by <b> Joerg Plewe</b>, it was published in <b> Forth
Dimensions, XVII, Number 1</b>).
<P>
To load these Forths, give the executable name on the command line
listing any files to initially load as command line arguments.
Various command line switches can be used to set up the initial behavior
of the system (for example <tt> PFE</tt> can be told to be case sensitive,
instead of the default non-sensitive).
<P>
There is no default configuration file that is read at startup.
<P>
<tt> ThisForth</tt> can be told to <i> interpret</i> the command line arguments
and not just treat the arguments as file names to load.
<P>
Under Unix/Linux, both <tt> ThisForth</tt> and <tt> PFE</tt> can be run as
stand-alone scripts (in place of <tt> perl</tt> or <tt> Bourne</tt> shell scripts)
by placing the following line as the first line of the Forth source file
that you want to run:
<P>
<tt> #! /usr/local/bin/forth</tt>
<P>
To run the program, just type the name of the file.
<P>
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img1.gif"><P>
<P>
Once the system is running, external files can be loaded and interpreted
through standard ANS words, e.g.:
<P>
<tt> s&quot; filename&quot; included</tt>
<P>
this is equivalent to the <tt> FPC</tt> sequence,
<P>
<tt> fload filename</tt>
<P>
A file can also be loaded and interpreted under <i> program</i> control by
opening a file and including it,
<tt> s&quot; filename&quot; r/w open-file</tt>
<BR>
<tt> abort&quot; file open failed&quot;  include-file </tt>
<P>
<H1> <b> File I/O</b></H1>
<P>
We have seen a little bit of how file I/O is handled.
<P>
<i> Personal note</i>: ANS Forth provides for Blocks or Files.  When running
Forth on top of an operating system that provides its own file system,
I find Blocks to be impratical.  They are not compatible with all the other
tools that I use external to Forth itself for managing my source code.
<P>
A file is opened with the <tt> open-file</tt> word which returns a file handle
and a success/failure flag.  This handle is then used for subsequent access
to the file.
<P>
The <tt> File Access</tt> wordset is fairly minimal, it provides the ability
to get/set a position within a file and to read/write bytes or lines.
There are no words to directly read/write a number in/to an ASCII file.
For reading one needs to
read in the characters and interpret them as a number separately.
For writing, an integer has to be formatted as characters and then written
out. <A HREF=ftp://ftp.taygeta.com/pub/Forth/ANS/fileio.fo> A separate set of
words</A> are needed for this.
